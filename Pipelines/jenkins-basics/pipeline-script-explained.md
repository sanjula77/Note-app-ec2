# Jenkins Pipeline Explanation

This Jenkins Pipeline script is a declarative pipeline, which is a structured and user-friendly way to define the CI/CD process in Jenkins. Here's a detailed explanation of each part of the script for beginners:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Pipelines are Jenkins' modern approach to CI/CD workflows using code.

### **Example Script:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the project...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing the project...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the project...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Pipeline Script Explanation

### **`pipeline` Block**

- The `pipeline` block is the starting point of the Jenkins declarative pipeline.
- It defines the entire pipeline process, including where it runs and what tasks it performs.

### **`agent any`**

- The `agent` section specifies where the pipeline will run.
- Using `any` means the pipeline can execute on any available Jenkins node (master or slave).
- You can configure specific agents (e.g., Docker containers or specific machines) if needed.

---

### **`stages` Block**

- The `stages` block contains one or more stages that define the workflow of the pipeline.
- Each stage represents a logical step in the CI/CD process, such as building, testing, or deploying.

### **`stage('Hello')`**

- A `stage` is a step or phase in the pipeline.
- The name `'Hello'` is an identifier for this stage. It could be something meaningful like `'Build'` or `'Test'` in real-world scenarios.

### **`steps` Block**

- The `steps` block contains the actual tasks that Jenkins will execute for this stage.

### **`echo 'Hello World'`**

- The `echo` command prints a message to the Jenkins console output.
- Here, it simply outputs `Hello World`, which is often used as a simple example or test to verify that the pipeline runs correctly.

## What This Script Does

- This script defines a pipeline with one stage named `'Hello'`.
- When the pipeline runs, Jenkins:
  1. Finds any available agent (machine) to execute the tasks.
  2. Executes the steps within the `'Hello'` stage.
  3. Outputs the text `Hello World` in the console.

---

## How to Run This Pipeline

1. Open the Jenkins dashboard.
2. Create a new pipeline job:
   - Go to **New Item** > Enter a name > Select **Pipeline**.
3. Copy and paste the above pipeline script into the **Pipeline** section under **Pipeline script**.
4. Save the job and click **Build Now**.
5. Check the console output to see the message `Hello World`.

## Why This is Useful for Beginners

- It introduces the concept of stages and steps in Jenkins pipelines.
- Demonstrates the basic structure of a declarative pipeline.
- Helps beginners understand how Jenkins pipelines execute tasks step by step.
